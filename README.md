# Explainable AI (XAI) for Cybersecurity: Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Introduction

The increasing use of Machine Learning models in Cybersecurity applications has raised concerns about their interpretability and transparency. This research project aims to develop explainable Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) models and improve their performance.
